# Elf size report

This script is based on [size_report](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/scripts/footprint/size_report) from Zephyr Project scripts. It has been almost fully rewritten but the idea is the same. It uses binutils programs (readelf, nm, c++filt) to extract information about symbols and sections from an ELF file and filters them. Information is presented in a tree based on paths to files where the symbols have been defined.

Requires Python 3, readelf, nm and (optional) c++filt. To be able to extract path information about symbols from ELF file, the program should be compiled with debug information.

If installed via pip, an entry point is generated and usage information can be retrieved by using

    elf-size-analyze --help

If working with a local copy of the repository, usage information can be retrieved by using

    python -m elf_size_analyze --help
